There are 3 datasets coming from their own respective sources.

Purchases-This data shows us the date that our business raised a purchase order for a particular product and the amount of the product.

Receiving- This when we as a company took stock of the materials, we have ordered e.g. the products arrived in our warehouse.

Billing-This is the transactional data of what we sold to which customer.

The task is to produce a single-page summary that gives us the below insight into our business.

There are 3 key things we want to see:

- From us placing a purchase order what is the time elapsed before we receive the goods into our warehouse
- From us receiving goods what is the time elapsed before we are billing for the goods
- Analyse the Billing

Note: Remember that the data is coming from three different sources so there is no existing keys or relationships between the tables
